### Feature
```
Java Platform module system, see Project Jigsaw on OpenJDK.
```

### Description
```
Introduced in this release.

The Java Platform module system introduces a new kind of Java programing component, the module, which is a named, self-describing collection of code and data.
Its code is organized as a set of packages containing types, that is, Java classes and interfaces; its data includes resources and other kinds of static information.
Modules can either export or encapsulate packages, and they express dependencies on other modules explicitly.
